Starlit night above the roof tops
I sit and think, what words could show you how I feel?
Our happy times were they real? So I wonder
Shooting star, falls as if to tell
A happy end will come because you're by my side
Always a smile but all the while
There's still one thing inside, that I cannot tell you
Secret of my heart, when can I ever start?
Never any doubt, knowing how someday I'll say I love you
It will shine on through, my love will shine out true
Give a little time, I'm looking for a sign
You know I'm waiting for my chance

So quiet now, winds whisper true to me
I feel a need, to scream out loud these things I feel
Celebrate this love I can't reveal I can't show you
So here we are, together once again
You seem to walk this little distance from my side
Your face it seems so sad
I wonder what you hide I wanna be close to you
Secret of my heart can you understand those parts
Hidden far away, in a place I run to, doesn't everyone
In my heart I know I must let our love grow
I can't say why
I know that I must find a way to call out for my chance

Can I tell the truth? No words come to my mind
They escape from my lips to the clouds above
Feeling in my heart, I can't hide
I can't hide anymore, 'cause I love you
I will be with you (with you, with you)
Wherever you are? (you are, you are)
Can you feel my heart?
Can you feel my heart?
Can't you see you're in my heart
But things may break apart
Maybe one day
It's difficult to say how long two hearts can beat as one
But I know now all the same
No change will come unless I play the game
I just wanna say, I think I might be ready, baby
(I just wanna say forever)
Can't you see you're in my dreams
I can't lose you, baby see?
Every time we meet
Every time we're near boy gives all meaning to my life
Baby don't get down, someday I will come around
Secret of my heart, our future is forever
Secret of my heart
Secret of my heart
Secret of my heart
Secret of my heart
Secret of my heart
